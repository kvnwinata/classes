1. Go to the working directory, then type "make" into the terminal. Run the a0 executable generated by typing ".a0 > file.obj" into the terminal.

2. I helped Guangyan Gao with the rotation.

3. The openGL red book was pretty useful, but I read it during the summer for my UROP.

4. There is no problem with the minimum requirements that I am aware of, but I did not have enough time to finish the VBO for the extra credit.

5. Yes:
a. hit 'r' to spin the model.
b. VBO implemented but not finished (I got segmentation fault error), so I commented it out.
c. pressing 'c' continuously will smoothly changes the color from red to green to blue, then jumps back to red.

6. I think this assignment is a great way to get started with openGL. I just wished I had more time to explore the extra credit more.
